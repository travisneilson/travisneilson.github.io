        <p>Hello Google. Let me tell you a story.</p>
        <p>Two days after we buried my Grandfather, my little girl came into the world. That was five years ago. I remember it clearly because the juxtaposition of those two events seemed so poignant to me.</p>
        <p>Shortly thereafter I wrote an article on my website titled “<a href="http://travisneilson.com/spheres-of-influence/" target="_blank">Spheres of Influence</a>”, in which I concluded that “to truly live an extraordinary life, you must strive to reach and influence as many people as deeply and as profoundly as you possibly can.”</p>
        <p>Since then I have done my best to do exactly that. I have sought to mentor and lead where appropriate, I have tried to make sure the work I created was always the kind that I was proud of; the kind that helps others pursue their own goals. Recently I’ve taken on a more public persona — teaching and motivating the next generation of creators through producing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DevTipsForDesigners" target="_blank">videos</a>, <a href="http://www.travandlos.com/" target="_blank">podcasts</a>, and <a href="http://travisneilson.com/#notes" target="_blank">articles</a> that are intended to teach professionalism and promote creative health.</p>
        <p>I see this opportunity to discuss a future with Google as an extension of this guiding principal. Google is a company famous for many things, and among them creating tools that uplift and push the human experience further. Google’s reach is unparalleled in executing these projects. This aligns perfectly with <a href="http://fullprocessdesigner.com/" target="_blank">my values</a>.</p>
        <p>Thank you for taking the time to have these discussions with me.</p>

        <ul>

          <li class="job-tubular">
            <h2>Senior Product Designer, Frontend Architect</h2>
            <strong><a href="http://tubularlabs.com">Tubular Labs</a></strong>
            <em>December 2012 &ndash; Present <span>(15 months)</span></em>
            <p>Tubular has inspired and challenged me in ways I never expected. Here I have designed systems and tools professionals use to enhance their own creative endeavors in online video. Clients range form YouTube Channel owners and Multi Channel Networks, to large brands like Pepsi and HGTV. Learning from the community and being inspired by all of these super creative people, I started my own YouTube channel, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/DevTipsForDesigners" target="_blank">DevTips</a>, where I teach people frontend development in my own special way.</p>
          </li>

          <li class="job-britely">
            <h2>Product Designer, Front End Developer, UX Planner</h2>

            <em>Septemeber 2011 &ndash; December 2012 <span>(1 year 4 months)</span></em>
            <p>An integral part of the core product team, not only did I create and code the visual designs for more than 5 pivots in this company, but I also was key in helping define the products from their inception and working through product management problems from idea validation to ux research and testing. At a startup like this, you wear many hats.</p>

            <p>Sparkart is a wonderful place to work. Our clients are some of the biggest entertainment acts in the world. It's awesome to have worked with that amazing team on clients like Janet Jackson, The Killers, Bon Jovi, Rascal Flatts, Ultra Music, Kathy Ireland and more. It was a sad day when I left the team.</p>

            <em>August 2008 &ndash; December 2010 <span>(2 years 5 months)</span></em>
            <p>I helped grow this little agency from four people to fourteen. I was instrumental in creating designs and developing campaigns and pitches that won us some very exciting clients and awards.</p>

            <h3>Music App <a href="http://www.travisneilson.com/music-app/" target="_blank" class="exit-link"></a></h3>
            <p>I listen to music while I work, I listen to music about 10+ hours a day. After getting excited about iTunes match and iTunes 11, I was deflated by the stale design of the default iOS Music app.</p>
            <p>What would any logical designer do when faced with such a problem? He would design his own version and try to find an iOS dev to help him bring it to life.</p>

            <p>For the past two years I’ve made weekly videos teaching and encouraging the next generation of web-builders.
